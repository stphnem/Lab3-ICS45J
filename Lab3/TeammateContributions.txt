Description of Program: The program will be the same as lab two except we are programming the Frame/Display as well as creating an applet for the bouncing Smileys.

Contributions: Both of us pair programmed the whole project with each other, switching on and off about every 15 minutes or so. Below are some of the methods each of us implemented while doing the typing. As for the applet, we reused most of the code from the other modules we made.
